## TODO

- [ ] Add a script to install all my linux packages
- [ ] Add a script to install all the programs

- [ ] Make all of the scripts work from just one install script
- [ ] Make my own version of neovim not reliant on lazyvim  

## CREDITS

This whole project would not be possible without the [*HyDE*](httpss://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE) scripts and their config files.

please check them out as **they are the ones who made this possible**.

The Neovim base is [*LazyVim*](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), if you want to use the nvim config files you will need to install LazyVim first.
